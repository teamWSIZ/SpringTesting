Notes on testing:

Proper way for service layer: 
* broad repos must be mocked
  * best: in memory DB-like, with sql scripts for setup
  * else1: own classes which implement same interface as true repo, and are substituted for real one
  * else2: own classes joined to tests via mockito
  * else: mockito fully mocked
  
  
  
Design antipatterns: 
* multiplying Service classes --> O(N**2) links in this layer
*
